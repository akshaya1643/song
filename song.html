            <h2> lyrics </h2>
            So I never really knew you
            God, I really tried to
            Blindsided, addicted
            Thought we could really do this
            But really, I was foolish
            Hindsight, it's obvious
            Talking with my lawyer
            She said, "Where'd you find this guy?"
            I said, "Young people fall in love
            With the wrong people sometimes"
            Some mistakes get made
            That's alright, that's okay
            You can think that you're in love
            When you're really just in pain
            Some mistakes get made
            that's alright, that's okay
            In the end, it's better for me
            That's the moral of the story, babe
            It's funny how a memory turns into a bad dream
            When running wild turns volatile
            Remember how we painted our house
            Just like my grandparents did
            So romantic, but we fought the whole time
            Should've seen the signs, yeah
            Talking with my mother
            She said, "Where'd you find this guy?"
            Said, "Some people fall in love
            With the wrong people sometimes"
            Some mistakes get made
            That's alright, that's okay
            You can think that you're in love
            when you're really just in pain
            Some mistakes get made
            That's alright, that's okay
            In the end, it's better for me
            That's the moral of the story, babe
            They say it's better to have loved and lost
            Than never to have loved at all
            That could be a load of shit
            But I just need to tell you all
            Some mistakes get made
            That's alright, that's okay
            You can think that you're in love
            When you're really just engaged
            Some mistakes get made
            That's alright, that's okay
            In the end, it's better for me
            That's the moral of the story
            Some mistakes get made (oh-oh)
            That's alright, that's okay (oh-oh-oh)
            You can think that you're in love (oh-oh)
            When you're really just in pain (oh-oh-oh)
            Some mistakes get made (oh-oh)
            That's alright, that's okay (oh-oh-oh)
            In the end, it's better for me (oh-oh)
            That's the moral of the story, babe (oh-oh-oh)
